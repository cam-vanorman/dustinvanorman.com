                                <p>This is based a three-part task set for three groups (N=30) that shows clear advantages for text based communications overall and face-to-face communications to a lesser extent over video-conferencing in each of the three experimental tasks concerning memory. The tasks were original and adapted to Chinese-English speaking university students; they were (1) a long-term memory task, (2) a semantic and implicit memory of grammatical structures task, as well as (3) a nonword repetition task examining working memory, and long-term memory.</p>

                            <p>This is a meta-analysis of matched-guise, questionnaire and qualitative studies assessing the attitudes Chinese university students from four cities (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Urumqi) have about the local languages of these cities, of Mandarin, and of English. The findings are that local varieties are preferred in measures of solidarity (with the exception of Shanghai women), while Mandarin is seen as language of practical use. Finally, English is considered practical for Hong Kong, but maintains some traits for both solidarity and pragmatism in Urumqi.</p>

                            <p>Students (N=64), in this study, completed questionnaires, group discussions, and interviews to assess their preparedness for study abroad and their likelihood of future success. The results were codified and the participants were placed into integration, separation, assimilation and marginalization acculturative strategy groups. These categories have been reliable to predict study abroad students’ linguistic, social, psychological and in some circumstances, academic success by Ward and Kennedy (1992, 1993, 1994) and other authors. Follow up studies are planned from 2016-2018 as these students go to the United States.</p>
